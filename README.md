This project analyzes customer retention using cohort analysis on transactional sales data. 
The goal is to understand user behavior over time and identify retention patterns across monthly cohorts.

## Tools & Technologies

- Power BI
- Jupyter Notebook
- DAX

## Project Overview
- Customers are grouped into monthly cohorts based on their first purchase.
- Retention percentage is calculated for each cohort across subsequent months.
- A cohort heatmap is built in Power BI using conditional formatting.
- Interactive tooltips display cohort size and retention KPIs for deeper analysis.

## Files
- `01_data_cleaning.ipynb` – Data cleaning and cohort preparation
